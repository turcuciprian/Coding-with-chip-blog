Polynomial regression is a powerful technique used in the field of machine learning and statistics to model non-linear relationships between variables. It involves fitting a polynomial function to a set of data points, enabling us to capture more complex patterns in the data compared to simple linear regression.

## The Polynomial Regression Equation

The formula for polynomial regression with one independent variable (X) can be expressed as follows:

```
O = tetha

y=O0+O(1)*x+O(2)*x^2+...+O(n)*x^n
```
