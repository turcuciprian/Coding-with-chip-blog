### What? why?

This is just a tabloid title. A clickbaity one. Unless I delete the youtube channel completely or sell it, I'm not really done with it, am I?

Then what is this post about exactly:  I'm not posting this announcement on youtube and only blogging about it, you could deduct my lack of interest into making a video and posting it there.

Yes, I won't be making any more videos exclusively and enthusiasticly there(on the youtube channel), not like before anyway, not with the same enthusiasm and drive. The reasons?

* I realised more and more that Youtube is a social media entertaiment platform. Even the education made on youtube must be entertaining or it's not going to be watched and promoted by the alogrithm.. I don't like that. I don't want to compete with attention hackers for attention in order to make my video popular or well known. My videos should be popular if the subject is of interest and if the presentation is reasonable, not specifically dopamine inducing or attention retention dedicated in a fast edit, many animations and entertaining visuals sort of way.
* Youtube is a single time post - place. The only edits you get are the ones where you cringe-delete parts of your already uploaded video. You don't get to adjust the video itself. update it or make updates. You only get to either remove parts of it or delete it altogether. Don't like that either.
* Tutorials with recording the screen and showing the viewer how you write code is not exactly the most efficient approach in my opinion. Because you cannot touch/edit/try the code (mostly). youtube is mostly  entertainment videos, all the way.
* Being a youtuber is a certain type of human being with a specific type of skills, energy and motivation. The more I do it the more I'm seeing feedback and realise that I am not like that, this is not for me.
* Text and blogging is much faster to see, fly trough, search , copy/paste, use, try out. Soon you will be able to easily have a LLM read a post for you and give you the bullet points or answer any question for you.
* Unless I am doing youtube exclusively, it's not worth the time and effort. It's extremely hard to work on a hard project and document it and edit the recording and make it entertaining and taking care of promotion, design (thumnail), SEO, support. I think a greater chance of success in something is focusing on that one thing (the project at hand)- and if I want to document it, I either give out the source code with a demo or write a short blog post about it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying "minimal effort". I'm saying, it's not efficient, it's not productive, if it's not a exclusive thing it's not a good direction, I don't like the process, the job, the direction, it's not for me, there are better more efficient ways to do things, also.... we don't really need to document everything.

With that in mind, I might make a video from time to time but nothing youtube like, nothing like before. Mostly to delive a short message and that also rarely.

##### Just to be clear


I might and will use the channel for important videos that make sense to be made in the manner that they make sense to be made (eg. I made something cool and I want to show, or I need to speak about something).

BUT!

Nothing recurring, nothing expected. 
When/If the need for a video will come, the video will come.

### What now?

R&D is on my list and I will be building cool (at least for me ) stuff, and I will write about parts of them here.

See? wasn't that easier to get trough, faster, no interrupting ads, no having to have to sit trough the entire thing to get the context, just visualising everuything and jumping to what's interesting?

Let's see how this goes.
