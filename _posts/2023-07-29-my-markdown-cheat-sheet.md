I am writing this blog in markdown, as I want it to be static and I am commiting and updating github pages. Yep, this blog runs on github pages, liked to the domain. So, for myself, and anyone else that needs it and finds it useful, I want to post a "my markdown cheat sheet" post, where I highlight the most useful markdown commands I am using, in a single place, so I may come back to it whenever I need to in case I forget anything.

# My Markdown Cheat Sheet

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format plain text documents in a simple and efficient manner. It is widely used for writing content for the web, creating documentation, and much more. In this Markdown cheat sheet, we'll cover various formatting elements and how to use them.

## Paragraphs and Headers

To create paragraphs, simply separate lines of text with a blank line. For headers, you can use the hash symbol (#) followed by the header text. The number of hash symbols indicates the header level.

Example:

\`\`\`
# Header Level 1
## Header Level 2
### Header Level 3

This is a paragraph. To create a new paragraph, add a blank line.
\`\`\`

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

**Unordered List:**

\`\`\`
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3
\`\`\`

**Ordered List:**

\`\`\`
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
   1. Subitem 3.1
   2. Subitem 3.2
\`\`\`

## Text Formatting

You can apply various formatting styles to text in Markdown.

**Bold Text:**

\`\`\`
**This text will be bold**
\`\`\`

**Italic Text:**

\`\`\`
*This text will be italic*
\`\`\`

**Underlined Text:**

\`\`\`
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">This text will be underlined</span>
\`\`\`

## Code Snippets

Markdown allows you to include code snippets easily.

**Inline Code:**

To highlight a specific word or code within a sentence, use backticks (\`) around the code.

\`\`\`
Use backticks to highlight \`inline code\`.
\`\`\`

**Code Blocks:**

For multiple lines of code, use triple backticks (\`\`\`) before and after the code block. You can specify the language for syntax highlighting.

\`\`\`python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
\`\`\`

## Adding Images

You can embed images in your Markdown document using the following syntax:

\`\`\`
![Alt text](URL of the image)
\`\`\`

For example:

\`\`\`
![Sample Image](https://example.com/sample-image.jpg)
\`\`\`

Remember to provide a descriptive alt text for accessibility purposes.

## Conclusion

Markdown is a powerful and versatile language for formatting text and creating content. With this cheat sheet, you now have a handy reference to help you write and structure your documents effectively. Whether you're writing a blog post, documenting code, or just formatting text, Markdown simplifies the process and lets you focus on the content.

Happy writing with Markdown! ðŸš€
