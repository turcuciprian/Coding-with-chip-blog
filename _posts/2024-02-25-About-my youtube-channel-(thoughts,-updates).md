I haven’t been posting a lot on youtube for a while now, and I have tried, on and off to make an update video from time to time, but now, after the latest update video (called purpose) and after taking it down, I realised some things (took it down because I realised some things).

## What things?

Youtube is there for entertaiment mostly. And people are doing entertaining videos. There are also educational videos, but those videos are pressured into becoming entertaiment gradually and eventually (my point of view) and the education focus is diminuated or lost.

I have felt that ever since I started the channel back in 06 aug 2019.

## What now?

While I tried to think of how I can do educational focused videos (not even tutorials… but educationally related < concepts, ideas, approaches >) it always came back to an entertaiment feeling eventually, an entertaining direction for focus and the pressure of the competition.

It’s hard to fight the system but not impossible. Question is: is that the best approach? the most efficient way to achieve a goal (my goal being providing tutorials of what I discover, learn).

So I guess a new, hopefully better approach is required to go forward ( as much as that makes sense and is obvious )

## The approach

I am thinking of going at it like this: 

1. I will work, discover, learn, achieve certain goals and will either do it publicly or privately on my github, 
2. I will or will not share some specific parts of my work on this blog (more technically), with code examples and explanations
3. When a specific approach, script , research service or product is finished, I will dedicate 30 minutes of my time to make a 10-15 min 1 take video about it.

That seems like the reasonable thing to do at the moment. If things will change and something better as an idea or approach will come along, I will write a post here.
